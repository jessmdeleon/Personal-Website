    <h2>Movies Watching</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> I enjoy going to movies, whether it's with friends
        or alone. Some of my favorite movies to watch are romance, 
        sci-fi, and Disney movies.  I enjoy going with friends sometimes, 
        but once in a while, I like to go alone just to treat myself to a date.

    <h2>Reading and Enjoy listening to music</h2>
    <img class="musicBook-img" src="/images/img_musicBook.jpeg" alt="musicBook"/>
    <p class="paragraph"> Once in a while, I like to step away from a computer or TV screen and just 
        read a good book. I enjoy reading a lot of romance novels more than actually 
        watching the movies. Moreover, my enjoyment is listening to gospel music; it has been the most 
        enjoyable sound and a source of peace for myself. Each day, I discover a new song that I really like, 
        and I keep it on repeat. I also like to find friends who share 
        my beliefs and enjoy talking about them.

    <h2>Going to church</h2>
    <img class="victory-img" src="/images/img_victory.jpeg" alt="victory"/>
    <p class="paragraph"> One of the most enjoyable things I like to do is going to church on Sundays and attending 
        young adults' night on Tuesdays. It's amazing how many people attend church every Sunday and 
        how each message of the service serves a purpose. What amazes me are the Tuesday nights, as there 
        are people of my generation worshipping our God. So much love and the opportunity to meet new people 
        make it the best because you get to connect in your faith, share, and recommend amazing worship songs.
